# Multiple Disease Prediction System


## Project Objectives :
The objective of the project is to create a web app comprsing of many machine learning models (like SVM, Random Forest, etc.). We are preforming Classfication and our aim is to do predictive analysis about whether a person has certain diseases (namely Heart, Liver, Diabetes and Parkinson's) along with goo accuracy.


## Data Collection :
The dataset is obtained from Kaggle. 

* Heart Disease Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset
* Diabetes Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathchi/diabetes-data-set
* Liver Disease Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/indian-liver-patient-records
* Parkinson's Disease Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vikasukani/parkinsons-disease-data-set


## Modelling :
The indivisual models for all four dieases are stored in form of .sav files  

The main packages used are numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn and sklearn. Different Algoritms such as SVM and RF were also used.


## More Info. :
The web app has been build using Spyder framework.

## Future Scope :
* Use multiple Algorithms and then compare them to get best possible accuracy.
* Add more disease to be predicted.


* ## Screenshots :
* Here are some screenshots of the Multiple Disease Prediction website:
